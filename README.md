# League of Bots

Yes, this is a LoL inspired game, nice guess. It is aimed to be a purely competitive 5v5 MOBA, each player controlling a bot and its abilities. However, the gameplay, objectives and gamemodes will be quite different from other MOBAs like LoL. We'll talk about that soon. As the game is developed, I will create a more informative and transparent wiki. Once something is in the code and functional enough to play, it will be explained around here. **Work in progress!**
